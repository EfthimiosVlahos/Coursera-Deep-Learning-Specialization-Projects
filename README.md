### Neural Networks and Deep Learning
  
#### What I Learned

During this course, I delved into the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. I gained insights into the significant technological trends driving the 
rise of deep learning, and I learned how to build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks. Additionally, I implemented efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
and identified key parameters in a neural network’s architecture. This course equipped me with the skills to apply deep learning to various applications.

### Structuring Machine Learning Projects

  
#### What I Learned

This course honed my decision-making skills as a machine learning project leader. I learned how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, 
prioritize error-reducing strategies, and navigate complex ML settings like mismatched training/test sets. Drawing from Andrew Ng’s invaluable experience, 
I gained insights into end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.

### Convolutional Neural Networks
  
#### What I Learned

Exploring the world of computer vision, I understood its evolution and exciting applications such as autonomous driving and face recognition. I gained hands-on 
experience in building convolutional neural networks, including recent variations like residual networks. I applied convolutional networks to various visual detection 
tasks and experimented with neural style transfer techniques on different 2D and 3D data sets.

### Sequence Models

  
#### What I Learned

In this course, I familiarized myself with sequence models and their applications, including speech recognition, music synthesis, and NLP. I became proficient 
in building and training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), GRUs, and LSTMs. My journey also involved diving deep into natural language processing, understanding word 
embeddings, and leveraging HuggingFace tokenizers and transformer models to address various NLP challenges.
